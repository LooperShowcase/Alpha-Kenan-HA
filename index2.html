    <h1>
      Turning, the striker took another touch, feinted just enough to unbalance
      the two goal-side defenders and slotted the ball into the bottom corner,
      an unerring piece of finishing for the only goal of that quarter-final in
      the Coupe de France. It was just what FC Barcelona's sporting director had
      hoped to see. Txiki Begiristain, who heads up player recruitment at
      Manchester City these days, had flown to Lyon to watch Karim Benzema play.
      It was April 2008, and Barca were in a flap.

        Real Madrid 2014–15: Debut season Kroos playing for Real Madrid in 2015
        Prior to joining Real Madrid, Kroos had a deal in place to join
        Manchester United after agreeing terms with David Moyes. However, after
        Moyes was sacked and Louis van Gaal replaced him, the Dutch manager
        decided against signing Kroos. Around the time of the 2014 World Cup he
        received a call from Carlo Ancelotti.[30] On 17 July 2014, Spanish La
        Liga club Real Madrid announced that they had reached an agreement for
        the transfer of Kroos, signing a six-year deal for an undisclosed
        fee.[31][32][33][34] The press reported that Kroos had cost between €24
        and €30 million.[31][35][36][33][37][38] Greifswalder SV 04, the
        successor to his first youth team, received €60,000 from the transfer
